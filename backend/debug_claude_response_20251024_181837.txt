I'll search for the Nike Blazer Low '77 Jumbo in black on Indian e-commerce platforms.Let me search for more specific product pages with direct purchase links and verify the black variant availability.Based on my search results, I found limited confirmed purchase URLs for the Nike Blazer Low '77 Jumbo in black variant on Indian e-commerce platforms. The search results show that:

1. **Flipkart** - Has the women's black variant listed but it's currently **out of stock** (marked "Sold Out")
2. **Myntra** - Has women's listings but they appear to be for white variants, not black
3. **Superkicks** - Has black variants but they are multi-color combinations (Black/White/Team Orange), not pure black
4. **Amazon.in** - Search results show listings but specific black variant product pages are not clearly accessible
5. **Nike.com/in** - The official Nike India site shows the product but the color shown is White/Rose Whisper, not black

The challenge is that the exact "black" variant (as specified in your requirement) appears to have very limited availability on Indian e-commerce platforms. Most listings show either:
- Out of stock status
- Multi-color variants (Black/White/Team Orange) rather than pure black
- Different product variants (Mid '77 instead of Low '77, or Vintage instead of Jumbo)

The search indicates that the Nike Blazer Low '77 Jumbo in pure black variant is either not currently available or not actively listed for purchase on major Indian e-commerce platforms. The Flipkart listing that showed the black variant is marked as "Sold Out" with no restock date indicated.
